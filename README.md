# nep with KOKKOS

In this LAMMPS Kokkos version of NEP, neighbor list computations are handled by Kokkos on the GPU, while energy and force calculations are performed through custom C++/CUDA operators. Compared to the earlier MatPL-2025.3 version, memory consumption has been reduced by nearly one-third, and inference speed has been significantly accelerated. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent parallel efficiency across nodes, enabling scalability to multi-node clusters.

* This Kokkos interface for NEP supports the nep.txt forcefield files trained with both `MatPL-2025.3(and later version)` and `GPUMD`.

* The code implementation is based on the NEP file parsing, descriptor calculation, and force evaluation routines from GPUMD 4.6 (https://github.com/brucefan1983/GPUMD). Building on this foundation, we have adapted it to LAMMPS's KOKKOS neighbor list conventions, meticulously optimized the kernels for descriptor and force calculations, and incorporated a multi-model deviation calculation feature for active learning.

# how to compile

## 1. copy files to lammpsfir

We recommend using the `kknep-pach.sh` script to automatically copy the nep code to the LAMMPS directory and modify the CMakeLists.txt file. The command is as follows:

```bash
bash kknep-patch.sh the/path/of/lammps/rootdir
```

* Currently, only versions stable_29Aug2024_update4 and lammps-stable_2Aug2023_update4 are supported (igher versions are not supported ) 
* The lammps-stable_2Aug2023_update4 is more faster than stable_29Aug2024_update4 in our test.

## 2. load the compilation environment

Compilation requires OpenMPI, CUDA, CMake, and GCC. We recommend using CUDA/11.6, OpenMPI/4.1.6, CMake/3.21.6, and GCC 8.5. Note that CUDA 11.8 and later versions require a more recent driver.

## 3. doing compilation

```bash
mkdir build & cd build

cmake -C ../cmake/presets/basic.cmake \
    -DPKG_MESONT=no \
    -DPKG_JPEG=no \
    -DPKG_KOKKOS=yes \
    -DPKG_NEP_KK=yes \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=yes \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=yes \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA_LAMBDA=yes \
    -DFFT_KOKKOS=CUFFT \
    -DKokkos_ARCH_AMPERE86=ON \
    -DTEST_TIME=ON \
    ../cmake

cmake --build . -j N #Number of cores for parallel compilation
```

```bash
# If you also need to compile the DP interface, please import the PyTorch path, import the MKL library, and enable the C++ STD17 standard for compilation.

export Torch_DIR=\$(python -c \import torch; print(torch.utils.cmake_prefix_path)\)/Torch

# Then, add the following option in cmake:
-DTorch_DIR=\${Torch_DIR}
-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17
-DPKG_MATPLDP=yes

# For the D3 interface, please add the following option in cmake. Note that D3 requires CUDA support and cannot be used in combination with matpl/nep/kk.
-DPKG_MATPLD3=yes

# NEP adopts single-precision inference by default. For double-precision inference, please add the following option in cmake.
-DPREC_NEPINFER=ON
```

# how to use
Reference case ./examples

```txt
pair_style   matpl/nep/kk  nep.txt
pair_coeff   * * Hf O
```

```txt
# for multi-model deviation
pair_style   matpl/nep/kk  nep0.txt nep1.txt nep2.txt nep3.txt out_freq ${DUMP_FREQ} out_file model_devi.out
pair_coeff       * * Hf O

```

## NEP-charge / qNEP

For `nep4_charge2` QNEP potentials, specify the reciprocal-space charge solver in the `pair_style` command with `kspace ewald` or `kspace pppm`:

```txt
# Ewald reciprocal-space solver
pair_style   matpl/nep/kk  nep.txt kspace ewald
pair_coeff   * * Hf O
```

```txt
# PPPM reciprocal-space solver
pair_style   matpl/nep/kk  nep.txt kspace pppm
pair_coeff   * * Hf O
```

By default, PPPM uses a power-of-two mesh selected from the simulation box size. For large systems, the
power-of-two mesh can consume substantial GPU memory; in that case, explicitly
request an FFT-friendly mesh whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, `5`, and `7`.

```txt
# PPPM with memory-friendly FFT mesh
pair_style   matpl/nep/kk  nep.txt kspace pppm pppm_mesh friendly
pair_coeff   * * Hf O
```

The mesh size is calculated as follows:

$$
K=min\left \{ n \ge m | n = 2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7 ^d \right \} 
$$


For example, with a 70-cell width of HfO2, the cell length is approximately 371.4 Å. Using a power of 2, the mesh size is 512 > 371.4Å. The entire mesh size is 512 * 512 * 512, which will consume a large amount of GPU memory. In this case, using the frinedly method, the mesh size is 375.

You can also set the mesh explicitly. This has the highest priority:

```txt
# PPPM with explicit mesh dimensions
pair_style   matpl/nep/kk  nep.txt kspace pppm pppm_mesh 384 384 384
pair_coeff   * * Hf O
```

The optional `pppm_spacing` keyword changes the target grid spacing used by
the automatic `power2` and `friendly` modes. Its default value is `1.0`.

The same option can also be written as `kspace_method ewald` or `kspace_method pppm`. Example LAMMPS inputs are provided in:

```txt
examples/nep-charge/lmps-ewald
examples/nep-charge/lmps-pppm
```
