# nep with KOKKOS

In this LAMMPS Kokkos version of NEP, neighbor list computations are handled by Kokkos on the GPU, while energy and force calculations are performed through custom C++/CUDA operators. Compared to the earlier MatPL-2025.3 version, memory consumption has been reduced by nearly one-third, and inference speed has been significantly accelerated. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent parallel efficiency across nodes, enabling scalability to multi-node clusters.

This Kokkos interface for NEP supports the nep.txt forcefield files trained with both `MatPL-2025.3(and later version)` and `GPUMD`.

# how to compile

## 1. copy files to lammpsfir

We recommend using the `kknep-pach.sh` script to automatically copy the nep code to the LAMMPS directory and modify the CMakeLists.txt file. The command is as follows:

```bash
bash kknep-patch.sh the/path/of/lammps/rootdir
```

* Currently, only versions stable_29Aug2024_update4 and lammps-stable_2Aug2023_update4 are supported (igher versions are not supported ) 
* The lammps-stable_2Aug2023_update4 is more faster than stable_29Aug2024_update4 in our test.

## 2. load the compilation environment

Compilation requires OpenMPI, CUDA, CMake, and GCC. We recommend using CUDA/11.6, OpenMPI/4.1.6, CMake/3.21.6, and GCC 8.5. Note that CUDA 11.8 and later versions require a more recent driver.

## 3. doing compilation

```bash
mkdir build & cd build

cmake -C ../cmake/presets/basic.cmake \
    -DPKG_MESONT=no \
    -DPKG_JPEG=no \
    -DPKG_KOKKOS=yes \
    -DPKG_NEP_KK=yes \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=yes \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=yes \
    -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA_LAMBDA=yes \
    -DFFT_KOKKOS=CUFFT \
    -DKokkos_ARCH_AMPERE86=ON \
    -DTEST_TIME=ON \
    ../cmake

cmake --build . -j N #Number of cores for parallel compilation
```
